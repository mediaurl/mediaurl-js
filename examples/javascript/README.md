# Example Javascript Addon

Very simple static WATCHED javascript addon.

However, it is recommended to use the typescript example as a starting point, to benefit from the autocomplete features.

## Start the server

```shell
cd examples/javascript
npm i
npm start
```

## Add the addon to the WATCHED app

1. Find out the local IP address of your computer.
2. Go to the "Add Addon" screen of the app.
3. Enter the IP of your plus the addon ID. For example `192.168.1.12/example-js`.
4. Press `Continue` and you will see the addon.
